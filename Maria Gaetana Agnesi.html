	<p>
		Maria Gaetana Agnesi (16 May 1718 – 9 January 1799) was an Italian mathematician, philosopher, theologian, and humanitarian. She was the first woman to write a mathematics handbook and the first woman appointed as a mathematics professor at a university.
	</p>
	<p>
		She is credited with writing the first book discussing both differential and integral calculus and was a member of the faculty at the University of Bologna, although she never served.
	</p>
	<p>
		She devoted the last four decades of her life to studying theology (especially patristics) and to charitable work and serving the poor. She was a devout Catholic and wrote extensively on the marriage between intellectual pursuit and mystical contemplation, most notably in her essay Il cielo mistico (The Mystic Heaven). She saw the rational contemplation of God as a complement to prayer and contemplation of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maria Teresa Agnesi Pinottini, clavicembalist and composer, was her sister.

	<h2>Contributions to mathematics</h2>
	<hr>
	<strong><i>Instituzioni analitiche</i></strong>
	<p>
		According to Britannica, she is "considered to be the first woman in the Western world to have achieved a reputation in mathematics". The most valuable result of her labours was the <i>Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della gioventù italiana</i>, (Analytical Institutions for the Use of Italian Youth) which was published in Milan in 1748 and "was regarded as the best introduction extant to the works of Euler". The goal of this work was, according to Agnesi herself, to give a systematic illustration of the different results and theorems of infinitesimal calculus. The model for her treatise was <i>Le calcul différentiel et intégral dans l’Analyse by Charles René Reyneau</i>. In this treatise, she worked on integrating mathematical analysis with algebra. The first volume treats the analysis of finite quantities and the second of the analysis of infinitesimals.

	<p>
		A French translation of the second volume by P. T. d'Antelmy, with additions by Charles Bossut (1730–1814), was published in Paris in 1775; and <i>Analytical Institutions</i>, an English translation of the whole work by John Colson (1680–1760), the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, "inspected" by John Hellins, was published in 1801 at the expense of Baron Maseres. The work was dedicated to Empress Maria Theresa, who thanked Agnesi with the gift of a diamond ring, a personal letter, and a diamond and crystal case. Many others praised her work, including Pope Benedict XIV, who wrote her a complimentary letter and sent her a gold wreath and a gold medal.

	<p>
		In writing this work, Agnesi was advised and helped by two distinguished mathematicians: her former teacher Ramiro Rampinelli and Jacopo Riccati.

	<strong><i>Witch of Agnesi</i></strong>
	<p>
		The <i>Instituzioni analitiche</i>..., among other things, discussed a curve earlier studied and constructed by Pierre de Fermat and Guido Grandi. Grandi called the curve versoria in Latin and suggested the term versiera for Italian, possibly as a pun: 'versoria' is a nautical term, "sheet", while versiera/aversiera is "she-devil", "witch", from Latin <i>Adversarius</i>, an alias for "devil" (Adversary of God). For whatever reasons, after translations and publications of the <i>Instituzioni analitiche</i>... the curve has become known as the "Witch of Agnesi".
